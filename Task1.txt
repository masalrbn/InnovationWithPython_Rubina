1.	Create three variables in a single line and assign values to them in such a manner that each one of them belongs to a different data type.

a, b, c = 1, 2.01, “Python”
print(a,b,c)


2.	Create a variable of type complex and swap it with another variable of type integer.

a, b = 5+6j, 1
a, b =b, a
print(a, b)


3.	Swap two numbers using a third variable and do the same task without using any third variable.

Without using third variable:

a, b = 5, 10
a, b = b, a
print(a, b)

Using third variable:

a, b = 3, 4
c = a
a = b
b = c
print(a,b)


4.	Write a program that takes input from the user and prints it using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x Version.

Using Python 2.x

inp = raw_input(“Enter a number:”)
print “You entered”, inp
Output: Enter a number: 2
	You entered 2

Using Python 3.x

inp =eval(input(“Enter a number :”) 
print(“You entered”, inp)
Output: Enter a number : 2
	You entered 2
	
	
5.	Write a program to complete the task given below: Ask users to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 , add the two numbers and keep the sum in another variable called z. Add 30 to z and store the output in variable result and print result as the final output.

a = eval(input("Enter a number between 1-10: "))
b = eval(input("Enter another number between 1-10: "))
z = a+b
result = z+30
print(result)



6.	Write a program to check the data type of the entered values. HINT: Printed output should say - The data type of the input value is : int/float/string/etc
	
  inp = eval(input("Enter an input: "))
 print("The data type of the input value is : ", type(inp))


7.	Create Variables using formats such as Upper CamelCase, Lower CamelCase, SnakeCase and UPPERCASE.
	
# Upper camel case
FirstName = "Rubina"

# Lower camel case
lastName = "Masal"

# snake case
favorite_topic = "Python"

# Upper case
FAVORITE_TOPIC = "Python"


8.	If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’ again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?
	
Yes, the value will change because re-assigning value to a variable will remove the old value and replace it with a new one in Python as Python is an interpreted
language and it runs code line by line.
